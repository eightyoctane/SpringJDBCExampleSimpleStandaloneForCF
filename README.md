SpringJDBCExampleSimpleStandaloneForCF
======================================

This is a standalone app based upon http://www.mkyong.com/spring/maven-spring-jdbc-example/ which has been enhanced to explicitly configure cloudfoundry services 

I've been unable to run this app on cf.com or on mcf, but each produces different errors.

mcf can't find the App.class file
cf.com can't start the java vm

The app runs fine directly as a java application in STS
